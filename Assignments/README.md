# **Assignments – Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

This folder contains all graded assignments for my Natural Language Processing (NLP) course. Each assignment is designed to deepen my understanding of how computers interpret, analyze, and generate human language. The work in this directory reflects both conceptual learning and hands‑on practice with NLP tools and techniques.

## **📘 Purpose of This Folder**
The Assignments directory serves as a central place to store:
- Completed homework and written responses  
- Jupyter notebooks associated with assignment tasks  
- Reflections, analyses, and short‑answer explanations  
- Any supporting files required for submission  

Each assignment will be organized clearly so it can be easily reviewed and referenced throughout the course.

## **🧠 What These Assignments Cover**
Assignments in this course may include:
- Identifying NLP in real‑world and pop‑culture examples  
- Text preprocessing and tokenization  
- Working with embeddings and vector representations  
- Sentiment analysis and classification tasks  
- Language modeling and generation  
- Reflections on ethical and societal impacts of NLP  

## **📂 Example Folder Structure**
As assignments accumulate, the folder may look like:

```
assignments/
│── A01_nlp_in_action/
│── A02_text_processing/
│── A03_language_models/
│── README.md
```

Each assignment folder will contain its own notebook, write‑up, or required files.

## **📝 Notes**
This README provides an overview of the purpose and organization of the Assignments directory. Individual assignment folders will include more detailed instructions and explanations as needed.
