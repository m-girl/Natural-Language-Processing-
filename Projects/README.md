# **Projects – Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

This folder contains larger, multi‑step, or long‑term projects completed for my Natural Language Processing (NLP) course. Unlike weekly labs or individual assignments, the projects in this directory focus on deeper exploration, applied problem‑solving, and integrating multiple NLP concepts into cohesive solutions.

## **🎯 Purpose of This Folder**
The Projects directory is designed to store:
- Capstone‑style work  
- Multi‑notebook explorations  
- Applied NLP experiments  
- Group or individual project submissions  
- Any extended analyses or reports  

Each project will be organized in its own subfolder for clarity and easy navigation.

## **🧠 Types of Projects You May Find Here**
Projects in this course may involve:
- Building and evaluating text classification models  
- Performing sentiment analysis on real‑world datasets  
- Creating simple chatbots or conversational agents  
- Exploring word embeddings and vector spaces  
- Working with sequence models or transformer‑based architectures  
- Investigating ethical considerations in NLP systems  

These projects allow for creativity, experimentation, and deeper engagement with the material.

## **📂 Example Folder Structure**
As projects are added, the directory may look like:

```
projects/
│── project01_sentiment_analysis/
│── project02_text_classification/
│── project03_chatbot/
│── README.md
```

Each project folder will include its own README describing the goals, methods, and results.

## **📝 Notes**
This README provides an overview of the purpose and organization of the Projects directory. As new projects are completed, they will be added here with clear documentation and supporting files.
