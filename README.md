# **NLP – Natural Language Processing Course Repository**

Welcome to my **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** course repository. This parent folder serves as the central hub for all coursework, labs, assignments, notes, and exploratory projects completed throughout the semester. The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey as I develop both theoretical understanding and practical skills in NLP.

## **📘 About This Course**
Natural Language Processing is the field of AI focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Throughout this course, I will explore foundational concepts and hands‑on techniques that power real‑world applications such as chatbots, translation systems, sentiment analysis, and more.

## **📂 Repository Structure**
This repository is organized into several subfolders, each with its own purpose:

```
NLP/
│── assignments/      # Graded coursework and written responses
│── labs/             # Hands-on exercises and Jupyter notebooks
│── projects/         # Larger or long-term NLP projects (if applicable)
│── datasets/         # Supporting data used in labs or assignments
│── README.md         # Overview of the entire NLP repository
```

Each subfolder includes its own README to explain its contents in more detail.

## **🧠 Skills and Topics Covered**
Throughout the course, I will work with concepts such as:
- Text preprocessing and tokenization  
- Language modeling  
- Word embeddings and vectorization  
- Sentiment analysis  
- Classification and prediction tasks  
- Sequence models and transformers  
- Ethical considerations in NLP  

Hands‑on work will be completed primarily in **Jupyter Notebooks**, with version control managed through **GitHub**.

## **🎯 Purpose of This Repository**
This repository is designed to:
- Track my progress throughout the course  
- Store and organize all NLP‑related work  
- Demonstrate my understanding of key NLP concepts  
- Provide a clean, well‑structured portfolio of my learning  

## **📝 Notes**
As the semester progresses, this repository will grow with new labs, assignments, and projects. Each addition will be documented and organized to maintain clarity and consistency.
