# **Datasets – Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

This folder contains datasets used throughout my Natural Language Processing (NLP) coursework. These datasets support labs, assignments, and projects by providing real or simulated text data for analysis, modeling, and experimentation.

## **📘 Purpose of This Folder**
The datasets directory is designed to store:
- Raw text files  
- CSV or JSON datasets  
- Sample corpora for practice  
- Data used in labs, assignments, or projects  
- Any supporting files required for NLP tasks  

Keeping datasets organized in one place ensures consistency and makes it easier to reference them across notebooks and scripts.

## **🧠 Types of Data You May Find Here**
Depending on the course activities, this folder may include:
- Sentiment analysis datasets  
- Tokenization or preprocessing samples  
- Chat logs or conversational text  
- News articles or reviews  
- Word lists or lexicons  
- Small custom datasets created during labs  

Each dataset will be used to explore different NLP concepts such as text cleaning, feature extraction, embeddings, classification, and more.

## **📂 Example Folder Structure**
As more datasets are added, the directory may look like:

```
datasets/
│── sample_texts/
│── sentiment_reviews.csv
│── tokenization_examples.txt
│── project_data/
│── README.md
```

Subfolders may be created for larger projects or grouped datasets.

## **📝 Notes**
Some datasets may be too large to upload directly to GitHub. In those cases, instructions or links will be provided in the relevant assignment or project folder. Each dataset will be accompanied by a brief description within its own folder or notebook explaining its source and purpose.
