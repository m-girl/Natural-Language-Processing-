# **Labs – Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

Welcome to the **Labs** section for my Natural Language Processing (NLP) course. This folder contains hands‑on exercises, notebooks, and exploratory work completed throughout the semester. Each lab is designed to build practical intuition for how machines process, understand, and generate human language.

## **📘 Purpose of This Folder**
This directory serves as a central place to store:
- Jupyter notebooks used in weekly lab activities  
- Code experiments related to NLP concepts  
- Notes, reflections, and exploratory tasks  
- Supporting files or datasets used during labs  

As the course progresses, this folder will grow into a collection of work demonstrating my understanding of NLP fundamentals and applied techniques.

## **🧪 What You’ll Find Here**
Typical contents may include:
- **Lab notebooks** (e.g., `lab01_intro.ipynb`, `lab02_text_processing.ipynb`)  
- **Markdown summaries** explaining key concepts  
- **Python scripts** for NLP tasks  
- **Practice exercises** involving tokenization, embeddings, classification, and more  

## **🎯 Course Skills Developed Through Labs**
These labs help reinforce:
- Understanding how computers interpret human language  
- Working with text data in Python  
- Using Jupyter Notebook for interactive experimentation  
- Applying foundational NLP techniques such as:  
  - Tokenization  
  - Text preprocessing  
  - Language modeling  
  - Sentiment analysis  
  - Vectorization and embeddings  

## **📂 Folder Structure**
As labs are added, the structure may look like:

```
labs/
│── lab01_intro/
│── lab02_text_processing/
│── lab03_classification/
│── datasets/
│── README.md
```

## **📝 Notes**
Each lab will include its own explanation or notebook describing the goals, methods, and results. This README provides an overview of the purpose and organization of the entire folder.
